'''
If you have any sequence eg - String, Lists using iteration
You can execute a set of commands on all the elements of
that sequence.

We perform iteration using a for loop.
'''

string = "ABCD 123" # String is a sequence of characters

for i in string:
    # print(i)
    # print(ord(i))
    pass

lis = [ 12, 3.14159, "Car", "Tiger", True ]
for i in lis:
    # print(i)
    pass

for i in range(10):
    # print(i, end = ", ")
    pass
